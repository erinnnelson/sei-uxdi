We aim to please and give you the pizza exactly how you like it. Please let us know if you prefer it well done, light or if there is any kind of topping you'd like to add to your pizza. If we have it in our shop, we'll put it on your pizza. We are also open to suggestions for new variations of pies, please share your ideas with Benny.</p>
